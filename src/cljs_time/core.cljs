(ns cljs-time.core
  "### The core namespace for date-time operations in the cljs-time library.

  Create a DateTime instance with date-time (or a local DateTime instance with local-date-time),
  specifying the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond:

```clojure
=> (date-time 1986 10 14 4 3 27 456)
#<DateTime 1986-10-14T04:03:27.456Z>

=> (local-date-time 1986 10 14 4 3 27 456)
#<DateTime 1986-10-14T04:03:27.456>

ss-significant fields can be omitted:

=> (date-time 1986 10 14)
#<DateTime 1986-10-14T00:00:00.000Z>

=> (local-date-time 1986 10 14)
#<DateTime 1986-10-14T00:00:00.000>
```

  Get the current time with (now) and the start of the Unix epoch with (epoch).

  Once you have a date-time, use accessors like hour and second to access the
  corresponding fields:

```clojure
=> (hour (date-time 1986 10 14 22))
22

=> (hour (local-date-time 1986 10 14 22))
22
```

  The functions after? and before? determine the relative position of two
  DateTime instances:

```clojure
=> (after? (date-time 1986 10) (date-time 1986 9))
true

=> (after? (local-date-time 1986 10) (local-date-time 1986 9))
true
```

  Often you will want to find a date some amount of time from a given date. For
  example, to find the time 1 month and 3 weeks from a given date-time:

```clojure
=> (plus (date-time 1986 10 14) (months 1) (weeks 3))
#<DateTime 1986-12-05T00:00:00.000Z>

=> (plus (local-date-time 1986 10 14) (months 1) (weeks 3))
#<DateTime 1986-12-05T00:00:00.000Z>
```

  An Interval is used to represent the span of time between two DateTime
  instances. Construct one using interval, then query them using within?,
  overlaps?, and abuts?

```clojure
=> (within? (interval (date-time 1986) (date-time 1990)) (date-time 1987))
true
```

  To find the amount of time encompased by an interval, use in-seconds and
  in-minutes:

```clojure
=> (in-minutes (interval (date-time 1986 10 2) (date-time 1986 10 14)))
17280
```

  Note that all functions in this namespace work with Joda objects or ints. If
  you need to print or parse date-times, see cljs-time.format. If you need to
  ceorce date-times to or from other types, see cljs-time.coerce."
